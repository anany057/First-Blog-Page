# First-Blog-Page

My first HTML blog page
I'm excited to share that I've created my first HTML blog page! I learned a lot in the process, including how to:

Place elements and understand their positioning properties
Use semantic and non-semantic tags properly
I'm still learning, but I'm proud of what I've created so far. I hope you enjoy reading it!

How to place elements and understand their positioning properties
HTML elements can be placed in a variety of ways, using different positioning properties. Some of the most common positioning properties include:

position: This property specifies how an element is positioned relative to its container. The possible values are static, relative, absolute, and fixed.
top: This property specifies the top position of an element, relative to its container.
left: This property specifies the left position of an element, relative to its container.
width: This property specifies the width of an element.
height: This property specifies the height of an element.
